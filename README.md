# prowse_mapping
The aim of this project is to load a `name` + `street_address` + `postcode` formatted list of locations and retreive the transit time to nearby `suburbs` using the `placement` package in `R`. 

The secondary aim is to map the set of locations.

Lastly, and yet-to-be-completed, to map the routes from a tagged subset of `locations` to nearby `suburbs`.
